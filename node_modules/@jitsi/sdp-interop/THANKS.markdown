Here I'd like to thank the people that have added features to sdp-interop or
have otherwise been involved with the project.

- [bgrozev][]: Implemented jshint and fixed a number of bugs.
- [mparis][]: Implemented tests with qunit and fixed a number of bugs.
- [jallamsetty1][]: 
    Modified the translation logic to rely on the most recent description provided instead of using the cached one.
    Fixed a number of bugs, added the ability to initiate a p2p call with another client.
    Added logic to re-use m-lines when sources leave and new sources get added to the conference.
