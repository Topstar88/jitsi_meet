# Item

**YOU SHOULD ALMOST DEFINITELY NOT BE USING THIS COMPONENT DIRECTLY**

This is a generic Item component, designed to be composed declaratively into other components.

Item is generally a layout component, concerned with visual presentation of the content provided via props.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @atlaskit/item
```

## Extending Item behaviour

If you need the Item component to have additional behaviour, it is recommended that you wrap Item in a [higher-order component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html).
