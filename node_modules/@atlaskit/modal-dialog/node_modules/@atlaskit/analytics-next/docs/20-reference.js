  ### UIAnalyticsEvent

  &nbsp;

  The class used to represent an analytics event triggered by a user interaction. It has the following interface:

${code`
/** An array of objects containing data provided by any AnalyticsContext
 * components in the tree above where this event was created. */
context: Array<{}>;

/** An array of functions provided by any AnalyticsListener components in the
 * tree above where this event was created. */
handlers: Array<(event: UIAnalyticsEvent, channel?: string) => void>;

/** An object containing an action field and other arbitrary data. Can be
 * modified via the .update() method. */
payload: {
  action: string,
  [string]: any
};

/** Create a new event with the same context, handlers and payload as this
 * event. */
clone(): UIAnalyticsEvent | null;

/** Fire this event on the given channel. Listeners on this channel will be
 * called. */
fire(channel?: string): void;

/** Modify this event's payload. Accepts either a function, which will be passed
 * the current payload and must return a new payload, or an object, which will
 * be shallow merged into the current payload. */
update(
  updater: | { [string]: any }
  | ((payload: { action: string, [string]: any }) => {
      action: string,
      [string]: any,
    }),
) => UIAnalyticsEvent;
`}

  <a name="withAnalyticsEvents"></a>
  ### withAnalyticsEvents

  &nbsp;

  ${code`import { withAnalyticsEvents } from '@atlaskit/analytics-next';`}

  A HOC which provides the wrapped component with a method for creating \`UIAnalyticsEvent\`s, via \`props.createAnalyticsEvent\`.
  See the section on [creating your own events](/packages/core/analytics-next/docs/concepts#creating-your-own-events) 
  in the Concepts page for a thorough explanation of how to use this component.

  Usage:

  ${code`withAnalyticsEvents()(Button);`}

  It accepts an optional map as its first argument, which provides a shortcut for passing a new analytics event as an additional parameter to the corresponding callback prop.

  Here's how that might look:

${code`
  withAnalyticsEvents({
    onChange: (createAnalyticsEvent, props) => {
      return createAnalyticsEvent({ action: 'change', checked: !props.checked });
    }
  })(Checkbox);
`}

  Whenever the wrapped component would fire a prop callback (in this case \`onChange\`), the corresponding function will be run first. It is provided with a function for creating an analytics event, as well as the component's props, and it should return a new analytics event. This event will automatically be added as an additional argument to the prop callback.

  Since creating and returning an event is such a common pattern an even more concise shorthand is supported:

${code`
  withAnalyticsEvents({
    onClick: { action: 'click' }
  })(Button)
`}

  You can simply provide a payload object and an event will be created automatically.


  <a name="AnalyticsListener"></a>
  ### AnalyticsListener

  &nbsp;

  ${code`import { AnalyticsListener } from '@atlaskit/analytics-next';`}

  An \`AnalyticsListener\` wraps your app and listens to any events which are fired within it.

  ${(
    <Props
      heading="AnalyticsListener Props"
      props={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../src/AnalyticsListener')}
    />
  )}

  <a name="AnalyticsContext"></a>
  ### AnalyticsContext

  &nbsp;

  ${code`import { AnalyticsContext } from '@atlaskit/analytics-next';`}

  Wrap part of your tree in \`AnalyticsContext\` to provide data to any events created beneath it. When an event is created it snapshots all of the \`AnalyticsContext\`s above it in the tree and creates an array from the data. It's up to you to parse this information when you handle the event.

  ${(
    <Props
      heading="AnalyticsContext Props"
      props={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../src/AnalyticsContext')}
    />
  )}

  <a name="withAnalyticsContext"></a>
  ### withAnalyticsContext

  &nbsp;

  ${code`import { withAnalyticsContext } from '@atlaskit/analytics-next';`}

  This HOC wraps a component in an \`AnalyticsContext\` and allows you to provide a default \`data\` value for it.

  Usage:

${code`
const ButtonWithContext = withAnalyticsContext({
  // Default context data
  component: 'button',
})(Button);

/* ... */

const Form = (props) => (
  <div>
    <Field />
    <ButtonWith Context
      // The consumer can overwrite the default context data
      analyticsContext={{ component: 'submit-button' }}
      {...props}
    >
      Submit
    </ButtonWithContext>
  </div>
);
`}

  Note: if a consumer provides a value for \`analyticsContext\` it is shallow merged with the default data.

  <a name="AnalyticsEvent"></a>
  ### AnalyticsEvent

  &nbsp;

  ${code`import { AnalyticsEvent } from '@atlaskit/analytics-next';`}

  A more generic type of event which only contains a payload and an update method. If you want to create an event outside of the UI you can create an instance of this class directly. Please see [UIAnalyticsEvent](#UIAnalyticsEvent) for more information.

  <a name="createAndFireEvent"></a>
  ### createAndFireEvent

  &nbsp;

  ${code`import { createAndFireEvent } from '@atlaskit/analytics-next';`}

  A helper to make firing an analytics event on different channels easier.

  Usage:

${code`
const ButtonWithAnalytics = withAnalyticsEvents({
  onClick: createAndFireEvent('atlaskit')({ action: 'click' }),
})(Button);
`}

This will create an event with the payload, fire it on the \`'atlaskit'\`
channel and return a clone of the event.
