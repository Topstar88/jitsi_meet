  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't *actually* supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this *internally* in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.

## 3.2.1

  - @atlaskit/button@10.0.0

## 3.1.0
- [minor] [cffeed0](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/cffeed0):

  - Type `withAnalyticsEvents` and `withAnalyticsContext` HOCs so that they do not lose flow types of the components they wrap when chained together.

    This will fix flow types not flowing through all of the components that we have instrumented with analytics as they are typically wrapped with both HOCs. To get flow types flowing
    through your components again, upgrade them to the latest version and also update their @atlaskit/analytics-next dependency to the latest version.

    We also now export `AnalyticsContextWrappedComp` and `AnalyticsEventsWrappedComp` parameterised types that allow you to explicitly type components wrapped with these HOCs which is necessary in cases where the HOC wrapping is extracted into another function.
