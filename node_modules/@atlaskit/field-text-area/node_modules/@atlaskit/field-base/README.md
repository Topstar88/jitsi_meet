# FieldBase

This component contains all the common behaviour and styles for fields

FieldBase provides an Atlassian Design Guidelines compatible implementation for:
* Labels: spacing, margins, accessibility.
* Fields: sizing, borders, colors, wrapping behaviour, hover/focus states.
* Validation: styles (built in validation coming soon!)

FieldBase components *will* work by themselves, but are really meant to be extended into a full field component.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @atlaskit/field-base
```

## Usage

Detailed docs and example usage can be found [here](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/core/field-base).
